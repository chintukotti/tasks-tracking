## 🧠 Overview

This app provides a clean and intuitive interface for:

## 🚀 Problem It Solves
- Users often forget to complete daily tracking → leads to data gaps.  
- Inconsistent tracking reduces habit formation and motivation.  
- Manual submissions add friction to daily usage.  
- Lack of automatic handling for absent days affects productivity analytics.
